# Chrome Extension to download Forvo Recordings
Creates links to download Forvo recordings.


Pretty self explanatory. Download the zip, extract it to a folder, go to Chrome -> Extensions -> Load Unpacked Extension (need developer mode enabled) and select the folder.

Then go to forvo.com and look up a word and there should be a download link next to each recording (you need to be on forvo.com/word/).
